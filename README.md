## Update the .gitignore file

Setup the `.gitignore` file for the project using [GitHubs gitignore lists](https://github.com/github/gitignore). 
For IDE's and operating system related ignores look into the [Global folder](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global).


## Getting startet

Use `npm install` to get the required modules and then start the dev server with
`npm run start`. Afterwards just open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
This will compile all JavaScript files into a new file using webpack with ES6
support.

For SASS use the following command in a new cmd-window: `npm run sass-watch`.
